/**
 * This interface represents a geometrical path tracked by a given cursor.
 * over a cartesian coordinate field. Every path is defined by a type, and
 * it can be made up of a series of sections so that the path itself is
 * regarded as a "polyline". Default implementations of this interface construct
 * "polyline" types of path. A path can also be considered as made up of a single
 * section,being regarded as a "shape" consequently. Every component section can
 * be defined by a different geometrical shape, represented by a "SectionType"
 * and an associated "PathElement". Every geometrical path is associated to only
 * one given cursor.
 *
 * Adding a section to a GeoPath is possible through the "add" method, which
 * takes a "SectionType" as arguments. Two paths can never be equal, according
 * to the "equals" method. This means that,whether two paths share the same
 * instance fields, they still are different and the most recent one overrides the older.
