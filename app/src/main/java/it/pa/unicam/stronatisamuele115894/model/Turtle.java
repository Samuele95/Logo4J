 * field. Every cursor is represented by a position in the cartesian coordinate field, together
 * with a direction (angle pointed by the cursor as compared to the cartesian coordinate field)
 * which is represented as an integer parameter whose value is in the range [0,360],a stroke color
 * (color of the path drawn by the cursor), a fill color (color of the area eventually drawn by
 * the cursor through a path) and a boolean parameter "plot", which is a flag used to signal whether
 * the cursor is actually able to draw a path or not. Two turtles can never be equal, according to
 * the "equals" method. This means that, whether two turtles share the same instance fields, they
 * still are different.
