/**
 * This interface implements a Logo drawing session. A sessions consists of a
 * turtle being the drawing cursor and a set of "string" commands used to direct
 * the cursor or change its parameters. Every turtle draws over a given "Field", which
 * is passed as argument to the turtle itself. The turtle draws "Paths" over the field,
 * which may be of different nature or shape. "Paths" may be composed of different types
 * of "Sections". The turtle is placed on a specific Position in any moment. This Position
 * must be inside the Field. Commands are "string based" and may take arguments of every type.
 * They represent means to guide the cursor during the execution of the program itself.
 * Every field is an instance of the "Field" interface. Every "Path" is an instance of the
 * "GeoPath" interface. Every "Section" is an instance of the "GeoSection" interface.
 *
 * Instances of this interface are immutable objects. They represent a session whose parameters
 * are fixed during the execution of the whole program. Therefore, it is advisable to create
 * "record" instances or final classes with final fields. Record instances are preferable though.
 *
 * The cursor and the command set are immutable dependencies which must be injected through
 * a specific SessionInjector.
